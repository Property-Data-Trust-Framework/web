# PDTF Site
This is the docs site for the property data trust framework. It's built using [starlight](https://starlight.astro.build), which uses astro. The sites consists of:
* Landing page
* API reference (using [stoplight elements](https://stoplight.io/open-source/elements))
* Schema reference (also using stoplight elements)
* Learn section containing:
    * Reference articles - currently containing an about page with the contents of the old landing page.
    * Guides - currently empty with an example. Guides can have interactive API calls and schema viewers embeded in them thanks to some hacky stoplight elements integration work I did.

The site is deployed to https://propdata.org.uk using github pages with the astro github action.

## Dev
This repo uses pnpm.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
