    <h1>ABOUT THIS FORM</h1>
    <p>
      The form will take a little time to complete but contains information
      which will speed up the legal process.
    </p>

    <h2>
      PART A - Getting the property 'Market Ready' (Disclosure of material
      facts)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whether you are the legal owner of the property or representing them you
      should complete this form as though the questions are being answered by
      the legal owner and based, as far as possible, on their personal knowledge
      of the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information you provide must be accurate. You must complete this form
      to comply with the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations
      2008 during the marketing of the property. Under these regulations it is a
      legal requirement to disclose anything that would materially affect the
      'average person's' decision to buy the property.
    </p>

    <h3>How will the information be used?</h3>
    <p>
      To comply with the regulations, the information will be displayed by the
      person marketing the property for anyone to view, this might include their
      own website or via the property portals.
    </p>

    <h2>PART B - Getting the property 'Sale Ready'</h2>
    <p></p>
    You need to complete the information in Section A to market your home and
    both Part A and Part B will be used during the legal process. Anyone making
    an offer to buy or lend money on the property is entitled to see Part A and
    Part B.

    <h3>How will the information be used?</h3>
    <p>
      Your property lawyer and your buyer's property lawyer and valuer will use
      this information as part of the legal process for selling your home and it
      will form part of the contract for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must answer all questions or it will delay the legal process. You must
      not leave out information which could affect a buyer's decision to
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any of the information changes before you complete the sale then you
      should let your estate agent and your property lawyer know about the
      changes, in writing, as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the property is leasehold, commonhold or a managed freehold, additional
      information forms will need to be completed by you and the person who
      manages the shared amenities. Your property lawyer will deal with this,
      but you can help by asking the property manager for details of their costs
      to provide the information and who your lawyer should contact to get the
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst you do not need a property lawyer to help you complete the form,
      instructing your property lawyer now will mean they can help you collate
      the information, review the answers which you have provided and may help
      you answer questions you aren't sure about. This can significantly speed
      up the legal process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure you give all of the documents which you have referred to in your
      answers to your property lawyer.
    </p>

    <h2>THINKING OF BUYING THIS PROPERTY?</h2>
    <p>
      The information contained in this form is intended to help you decide
      whether the property is suitable for you. However, if there is a
      particular reason you are buying the property (e.g. to let it, extend it,
      run a business from it, etc) you should double check with your property
      lawyer and surveyor whether there is anything which might affect that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information given by the seller is based on their own knowledge and
      opinion. You should assume that the seller is not a legal expert, surveyor
      or building maintenance expert and that any information is given as a home
      owner, or their representative, and can only be relied upon to that
      extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should verify any answers which are important to you with your
      property lawyer or surveyor or ask for quotes from the appropriate trade
      experts, e.g. builder, plumber, electrician, damp and timber expert, etc.
